We expect to resume our countdown at about 48 minutes from this time at 6:02am, Eastern Daylight Time. All elements of the Apollo 11 countdown are GO at this time. We're heading for a planned liftoff on the Apollo 11 mission at 9:32am Eastern Daylight. The prime crew for Apollo 11 is Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin. Were awakended ... just about an hour ago, at 4:15am, Eastern Daylight. At this time, after successfully completing a ... determination, they're sitting down for breakfast. The breakfast menu, the usual astronaut fare on launch day, of orange juice, tenderloin steak, scrambled eggs, toast, and coffee. Joining the prime crew for breakfast are two members of the Apollo 11 team who have worked with the astronauts during their preperation. The first is the Director of Flight Crew Operations, the astronauts Bob Donald K. Slayton, and the second member joining the crew for breakfast, astronaut Bill Anders. Bill Anders has served as the backup Command Module Pilot during all preparations for the Apollo 11 mission. Anders, of course, did fly the 3rd seat on the first mission - manned mission to the moon, Apollo 8 back last December. Anders was a member of that crew. Astronaut, Bill Anders also shortly will assume the position as Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics Space Council. So, Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton and Backup Command Module Pilot, Bill Anders having breakfast with the prime crew at this time. Following breakfast, the crew will go into their final preparations donning their space suits. They're not expected to depart from their crew quarters at the Kennedy Space Centre for the trip to the launch pad for another hour and 10 minutes or so. Meanwhile, here in Firing Room 1 at the Launch Control Centre Complex 39, all going well as the team here in the firing room continues to monitor the status of all the propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle during this phase of the built-in hold. Shortly, a close-out crew of four crewmembers will be sent to the pad, they will go up to the 320-foot level where the Apollo 11 Command Module is located, and proceed to open the hatch of the spacecraft which has been closed during the propellant loading phase of the launch vehicle. The crew, which includes the astronaut, Fred Hayes, will then make some preliminary preparations for the arrival of the prime crew for Apollo 11 who will come aboard later in the count. That is our status at this time, once again to repeat: the astronauts now sitting down for breakfast having their usual breakfast of steak and scrambled eggs. Joining them, Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, and the backup Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 11 mission, astronaut Bill Anders.

Here in the firing room of Complex 39, the crew continuing to monitor the status of the propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle. We've loaded more than 3/4 of a million gallons of liquid oxygen / liquid hydrogen aboard the three stages of the Saturn V since the countdown resumed late last evening. Weather forecast also very acceptable for a launch attempt this morning. The forecast called for scattered clouds at altitudes about 15000 feet in the Kennedy Space Centre area. Visibility will be 10-15 miles. Winds in the launch area at launch time, from the southeast at 5-10 knots. The sea state off Cape Kennedy is satisfactory. And weather in round the world track, the various contingency areas required during the powered phase of the mission, all weather conditions acceptable around the track. We are GO, but we remain in our planned, built-in hold at this time.

Each one of these thrusters is capable of 100 pounds of thrust, there are 16 of them located in 4 quadrants around the Service Module. We pressurize the system with helium prior to launch to make sure that all will be in readiness for use in space. The countdown still proceeding satisfactorily. We picked up at the T-minus 9 hour mark at 11:00pm. Eastern Daylight Time last evening. We've just had 2 comparatively minor problems since that time. The major portion of the countdown during the early morning hours, some 5 hours of work was taken, to load the various propellants aboard the stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. As we came into the count this morning we did already have the fuel aboard the first stage, but it was necessary to bring the liquid oxygen aboard all 3 stages and the liquid hydrogen fuel aboard the second and third stages. Close to 3/4 of a million gallons of propellants were loaded during these 5 hours. Following that the astronauts, the prime crew, were awakened at 4:15 a.m. Eastern Daylight as planned in their countdown, and proceeded to have their physical examination in which they were declared flight ready. They sat down for the normal astronaut fare on launch day as far as breakfast is concerned, orange juice, steak, scrambled eggs, toast and coffee. The 3 pilots were joined by 2 of their colleagues at breakfast, Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton and the backup Command Module Pilot, Bill Anders who has been named the Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The astronauts departed from their crew quarters - after checking out their suits, they departed from the crew quarters at 6:27am and some 27 minutes later, 8 miles away from the crew quarters at the Kennedy Space Center a top the launch pad at complex 39, 6:54am. the commander, astronaut, Neil Armstrong, was the first aboard the spacecraft. He was followed about 5 minutes later by Mike Collins and finally Buzz Aldrin, the man who is sitting in the middle seat during liftoff, was the third astronaut to come aboard. Two minor problems have been encountered during the count - early in the count a malfunction light came on here in the Control Center indicating that we might have a communication problem at the launch pad. Nothing to do with the spacecraft, but it indicated we possibly might not be able to talk to some key technicians we had at the pad. The problem turned out to be very minor, a simple adjustment of some equipment beneath the pad remedied the problem. There was no, in fact, no equipment problem involved. The second problem, we did encounter a leaky valve in part of the equipment that is used to replenish the hydrogen fuel supply on the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. A team of technicians were sent out to the launch pad, at about the time the astronauts were traveling to the pad. They tightened some bolts and we were able to bypass this valve and to proceed with our countdown. The weather is certainly GO. It's a beautiful morning for a launch to the Moon. We expect a temperature of about 85 degrees in the Kennedy Space Center area. The winds about 10 miles - 10 knots, rather from the southeast, and the weather conditions in the round-the-world track, according to reports to the Manned Space Flight Meteorology Group indicate all weather conditions are acceptable for launch.

The turnaround maneuver - I went PITCH ACCEL COMMAND and started to pitch up, and then when I put MANUAL, ATTITUDE PITCH back to RATE COMMAND for some reason it - it stopped its pitch rate, and I had to go back to ACCEL COMMAND and hit what I thought was an extra PROCEED on the DSKY. During the course of that, we drifted slightly further away from the S-IVB than I expected. I expected to be out about 66 feet. My guess would be I was around 100 or so; and therefore, I expect I used a bit more coming back in. But, except for using a little more gas - And I'd be interested in your numbers on that - everything went nominally.",

At the present time the spacecraft is 29,363 nautical miles from Earth and the velocity continuing to drop off gradually, reading now 11,192 feet per second. Flight Director, Gene Kranz, has taken over as Flight Director now from Clifford Charlesworth. Kranz has been reviewing the status of the spacecraft's systems with his team of Flight Controllers; everything looks very good at this point. The crew has been advised that the mid-course correction 1, the first opportunity for a mid-course correction, which had been scheduled into the Flight Plan at about 13 hours, 30 minutes, will not be performed. A correction of mid-course had been scheduled at 11 hours, 45 minutes into the Flight Plan and that will not be performed according to the tracking data we have at this time. The crew, up until their sleep period which will begin in about 13 hours, 30 minutes or about 7 hours from now will be involved generally in a routine of housekeeping type activities aboard the spacecraft. At the present time they should be involved in some mid-course navigations. At 6 hours, 32 minutes this is Apollo Control of Houston.",

At about 11 hours, 20 minutes we said good-night to them from Mission Control and they're beginning their sleep period about 2 hours early. The additional time available for sleep was made available by deleting the mid-course correction. The first opportunity which occurred at 11 hours, 45 minutes. That mid-course correction has been moved to mid-course correction 2 to the opportunity of mid-course correction 2 of which would occur tomorrow. The last conversation we had with the crew, we received a status report and a report that they had taken no medication and were \"fit as a fiddle\". We also got a report from Mike Collins on the gas separation unit which is being flown on this flight. This consists of 2 stainless steel cylinders about 5 inches long and about an inch to an inch and half in diameter. The cylinders are attached to the water gun or to the water spigot on the food preparation panel and remove the gas from the water as it flows through the filter. The filter actually has two filters inside. One which attracts water and one which repels it, in the process removing the gas. Mike Collins reported that the filters seem to be working quite well. That the water was coming out almost free of bubbles. He did report that they had a minor problem with a leak at the junction between the food bag and the filter. Mission Control advised that we would give that some thought and try to come up with some solution to it when they wake up tomorrow.

    "This is Apollo Control. We don't anticipate a great deal of further conversation with the crew. We expect they will attempt to get some sleep shortly. The conversation that just ended, we advised that through one of the computer programs, the deadband, or that area of excursions which the guidance system will allow before firing the RCS thrusters to correct it, had been narrowed from 30 degrees to 1/2 a degree. What this would mean, if the RCS jets were enabled, is that unless the crew reselected the 30 degree deadband, the jets would be firing more frequently to keep the spacecraft within the narrower limits. Since the spacecraft is very stable at this point, very few wobbling motions, it was felt that the narrower deadband was acceptable; the jets are not enabled, and the crew would not be disturbed by firing of the Reaction Control System jets even if the spacecraft moved out of the 1/2-degree deadband. In the event of any large excursions, which we would not expect, based on the Passive Thermal Control mode, used in Apollo 10, it would be possible to awaken the crew from the ground and have the situation corrected. We would not expect, however, for the spacecraft attitude to change significantly during the night, and we do intend to continue in the Passive Thermal Control mode as it is presently set up.

    "Okay. From Jodrell Bank, England, via AP: Britain's big Jodrell Bank radio telescope stopped receiving signals from the Soviet Union's unmanned Moonshot at 5:49 EDT today. A spokesman said that it appeared the Luna 15 space ship \"had gone beyond the Moon.\" Another Quote: \"We don't think it has landed,\" said a spokesman for Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of the Observatory. Washington UPI: Vice President Spiro T. Agnew has called for putting a man on Mars by the year 2000, but Democratic leaders replied that priority must go to needs on Earth. Agnew, ranking government official at the Apollo 11 blastoff Wednesday, apparently was speaking for himself and not necessarily for the Nixon administration when he said, \"We should, in my judgment, put a man on Mars by the end of this century.\" Laredo, Texas, AP: Immigration officials in Nuevo Laredo announced Wednesday that hippies will be refused tourist cards to enter Mexico unless they take a bath and get haircuts. Huberto Cazaras, Chief of Mexican Immigration in Nuevo Laredo, said authorities in Mexico City, Acapulco, and other popular tourist spots have registered complaints about the hippies. By United Press International: Initial reaction to President Nixon's granting of a holiday Monday to Federal employees so they can observe a national day of participation in the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission mostly was one of surprise. Rodney Bidner, Associated Press, London AP: Europe is Moonstruck by the Apollo 11 mission. Newspapers throughout the continent fill their pages with pictures of the Saturn V rocket blasting off to forge Earth's first link with its natural satellite. And the headline writers taxed their imagination for words to hail the feat. \"The greatest adventure in the history of humanity has started,\" declared the French newspaper Le Figaro, which devoted four pages to reports from Cape Kennedy and diagrams of the mission. The tabloid Paris Jour proclaimed, \"The whole word tells them bravo.\" The Communists daily L'Humanite led with the launch picture and devoted its entire back page to an enthusiastic Moon report describing the countdown and launch, the astronauts' wives and families, and backgrounding lunar activities. Hempstead, New York: Joe Namath officially reported to the New York Jets training camp at Hofstra University Wednesday following a closed door meeting with his teammates over his differences with pro football Commissioner Peter Rozelle. London UPI: The House of Lords was assured Wednesday that a midget American submarine would not \"damage or assault\" the Loch Ness monster. Lord Nomay said he wanted to be sure anyone operating a submarine in the Loch \"would not subject any creatures that might inhabit it to damage or assault.\" He asked that the submarine's plan to take a tissue sample with a retrievable dart from any monster it finds can be done without damage and disturbance. He was told it was impossible to say if the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act would be violated unless and until the monster was found. Over.",

    "Okay. For today, we'd like you on P23 to make a trunnion bias determination, prior to P23 sightings as called out in procedures, and also one afterwards. Our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular read-out in the sextant. The bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated, that is a PROCEED on NOUN 87 after you get two consecutive measurements equal to within 0.003 degrees. And, of course, move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today, and I'm sure you're a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are, but to ensure that you're getting a good angle measurement between the star and the Earth horizon, the sextant M-line, which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the R-line, should be parallel to the Earth's horizon at the sub-stellar point. And then the actual superimposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant: above, below, or on the M-line. We recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after AUTO maneuver. If you feel that the amount of time between the AUTO maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive, or that you don't like that AUTO maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark, of course, you can use a VERB 94, that's VERB 94, to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the AUTO maneuvers.

During the TV transmission the crew advised that they may possibly be able to take the color television camera into the Lunar Module with them tomorrow at about 56 hours, 30 minutes, Ground Elapsed Time. They reported that the cables had been checked and are appeared to be long enough to take them into the Lunar Module. During the next hour or so the activity here in Mission Control will be revolving on, getting the crew set up for their rest period and eat period. This will be a very long rest period tonight, scheduled 10 hours. That will begin according to the Flight Plan, at about 37 hours, Ground Elapsed Time. However, we would anticipate if activities move along as they appear to be at this point, we are somewhat ahead of the Flight Plan, that perhaps again tonight we would be able to get the crew into their rest period and sleep period a little bit early.

In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the weather bureau, after recapping today's weather showing a high of 88 and a low of 72, has noted \"snowfall: none.\" From St. Petersburg, Florida, comes a radio report from the Norwegian explorer, Thor Heyerdahl, which said that the crew of his papyrus boat, the Ra, will sail into Bridgetown, Barbados, despite damage from heavy seas. The crew, however, will sleep on an escort vessel. Norman Baker, navigator of the expedition, said the crew was aboard the Ra today repairing damage from storms this past week, which split the footing of the mast. Part of the broken mast was jettisoned overboard, and the vessel was 725 miles east of the Barbados. \"It is possible but uncomfortable to sleep aboard the Ra,\" Baker said in the radio report. \"But the purpose of our voyage is not a test of strength or human endurance.\" That is the reason why the crew was spending nights aboard the escort vessel Shenandoah, which rendezvoused with the Ra on Tuesday.",

We've had very little conversation from the spacecraft in the past 40 minutes or so. At this time the Flight Plan calls for the crew to be getting ready to begin their eat period. That would be followed by a 9 hour rest period. We have one change to the Flight Plan to pass along. The television transmission which had been scheduled at 100 hours, 20 minutes to 100 hours, 50 minutes in the Flight Plan has been deleted. This transmission was to have occurred during the formation flying prior to the powered descent to the lunar surface. The decision to delete the TV transmission from the Flight Plan was made due to a lack of available satellite channels to relay the signal from the tracking site of Madrid to Houston for conversion. The intermittent music that we're getting is apparently coming from the spacecraft. The crew has onboard portable tape recorders with music on the tapes. As they store their own comments on the tape, the music of course is erased, and apparently the music is triggering the VOX operated microphones and we're getting intermittent music down from the spacecraft.",

We had noticed a unexplained deviation from the attitude that the spacecraft was set up in. In this roll mode, ideally, it would roll about the longitudinal axis with very little wobble and if wobble is introduced for one reason or another, the Reaction Control System jets would come on as soon as the motion out of the prescribed plane had occurred and gone beyond prescribed limits, in this case 30 degrees to correct.

And at the present time, Apollo 11 is 184,600 nautical miles from Earth. The spacecraft velocity is presently 3,023 feet per second. I understand there has been some interest in a comment made by Neil Armstrong during the television transmission about the EVA floodlight. Armstrong's remark was that the mast which the light is mounted on, appeared charred. He reported that the light works but had apparently the mast that supported it had apparently been damaged during the launch phase. This light would be used in the event of a contingency EVA. It would have no function in a normal mission such as we are presently flying. And in the event that a extravehicular activity was necessary for transfer of the crew from the LM into the Command and Service Module, the light would be an aid in providing exterior lighting of the hand rails, but would - repeat, that it'd have no function in a normal mission and the charring which Armstrong reported is not considered significant at this time. We don't expect to have any further conversation with the crew. We will continue to record any remarks that we get and play those back. The Passive Thermal Control mode, which was reestablished, appears to be functioning well at this time and all spacecraft systems are functioning normally.

Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses but is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also supposed to have \"intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling,\" Buzz is supposed to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone, in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she decided he either has the same attributes as Neil or that he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative.

The banks are the drive mechanisms for the ball valves in the Service Propulsion System. They open and close these ball valves. The valves allow the fuel and oxidizer to flow into the engine. There are redundant valves and redundant banks, banks A and B. There was apparently - they are driven by nitrogen and that was the reference to the pressure drop there. It was apparently a leak in nitrogen tank B during the LOI 1 burn. This burn was performed with both banks open. The engine can be operated with only one bank. It's apparent that the tank leaked only during the burn while the bank was actuated. Pressure has held steady since the end of the burn and the experts are reducing the data and looking at the leak rate, determining whether it was constant throughout the burn, what - precisely what the situation is. We're showing pressure in tank B of 1960 psi. In tank A 2250 psi. Both of these are well above the red lines of 400 pounds psi.",

    "This is Apollo Control, Houston at 79 hours 51 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We are some 20 minutes away, at this time, of ignition for Lunar Orbit Insertion burn number 2. This - the fine tune second burn in the series of two as we have inserted into lunar orbit. For LOI2, the Apollo 11 will be heads down. The burn will be initiated near perilune as the spacecraft passes over the far side of the Moon. Retrograde, like LOI1, but unlike Apollo's 8 and 10. The burn will not be targeted to place a spacecraft into a precise circular orbit. Taking what was learned on Apollo 10, this LOI2 burn is designed to take into account predicted perturbations and gradually circularize itself. The numbers that we're looking at for LOI2, that would be time of ignition, 80 hours 11 minutes 36 Seconds, which should change our orbital parameters, giving us an apolune of 65.7 nautical miles and a perilune of 53.7 nautical miles. The Delta-V intended for this burn, 159.2 feet per second. Burn duration anticipated 17 seconds. That's a burn of short duration, but certainly important in that it establishes the proper orbital parameters for the events that lie ahead. As you heard in earlier conversation, between our capsule communicator, Bruce McCandless and crew members aboard the spacecraft. We're GO for LOI-2. During this burn, we'll utilize only the bank A ball valve. The bank referred to here, which there are two mechanisms that drive the ball valves open and shut, causing fuel and oxidizer to mix for ignition. At the present time in Mission Control Center, the last reference you've heard from our capsule communicator reflects that they, on their own peculiar shift schedule, are having a change-of-shift. Astronaut Charles Duke has arrived on the scene and we can assume will take over the responsibilities of the conversational flow with the Apollo 11 spacecraft, once we reacquire. At 79 hours 55 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Apollo Control, Houston.",

I believe back in the viewing room, we probably have one of the largest assemblages of space officials that we've ever seen in one place. Included among the viewers are Dr. Thomas Paine, NASA Administrator, Jim Elms, Director of the Electronic Research Center at Cambridge, Dr. Abe Silverstein, Director of NASA's Lewis Research Center, Rocco Petrone, Director of Launch Operations at Kennedy Space Center is there. From Marshall Space Center, we have Dr. Wernher von Braun, the Director, and his Deputy, Dr. Eberhard Rees. Also a large number of Astronauts including Tom Stafford, Gene Cernan, Jim McDivitt, and John Glenn. We also see Dr. Kurt Debus, Director of the Kennedy Space Center, Dr. Edgar Cortright, Director of the Langley Research Center. Dr. S. Draper, Director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Instrumentations Laboratory is also in the viewing room. Here in the Control Room proper, down on the floor a number of Astronauts including Pete Conrad, Fred Haise, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders, and Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center. Sitting beside us in the back row of consoles here is Dr. Robert Gilruth, Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center. Further down on the line is General Sam Phillips, Director of the Apollo Program. Also Chris Kraft is here, Director of Flight Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center, and George Low of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager. We also see in the back viewing room, Secretary of the Air Force, Seamans, and many others who I'm sure we can't see through the glass.

We're now 2 minutes 53 seconds from reacquiring the spacecraft, 21 minutes 23 seconds from the beginning of the powered descent to the lunar surface. It's grown quite quiet here in Mission Control. A few moments ago Flight Director, Gene Kranz requested that everyone sit down, get prepared for events that are coming, and closed with a remark \"Good luck to all of you\". Here on the front of our display boards we have a number of big plot boards which will be used to keep track of the burn progress. Along the more important of those is one which will show the performance of the onboard guidance systems, both the primary and the back up guidance system and compare the guidance systems with the Manned Space Flight Network tracking. These displays, by the time this is all over, will look a great deal like a combination Christmas tree and Fourth of July. We're now 1 minute 39 seconds from reacquiring the Command Module, Columbia. Acquisition of the Lunar Module will come a little less than 2 minutes after that. At the time we acquire the LM it should be at an altitude of about 18 nautical miles descending toward the 50,000 foot pericynthion from which point the powered descent to the lunar surface will be initiated. If for any reason the crew does not like the way things look as they are coming across the pericynthion, simply by not initiating the maneuver they will remain in a safe orbit of 60 miles by 50,000 feet, and if they desired they would be able to attempt the powered descent on the following revolution at a Ground Elapsed Time of about 104 hours 26 minutes. We're now coming up on 30 seconds to acquisition of the Command Module and we'll stand by for that event.",

    "This is Apollo Control. A little over 2 minutes until Columbia comes over the hill again on the 24th Lunar Revolution. In that wake up call to Eagle, the crew described how they slept in the spacecraft by lying on the floor and on the engine cover. Some of the preliminary times being generated now ascent show ignition about 1 minute 26 seconds earlier than the pre-mission Flight Plan. Ignition time now showing 124 hours 22 minutes 0 seconds. Burn will have a magnitude of 6,068 feet per second. Quite a bit of that will be in vertical rise and actually starting from zero feet per second on the lunar surface. The CSI maneuver behind the Moon, the Concentric Sequence Initiate, CSI the acronym being for that maneuver. 125 hours 19 minutes 34 seconds. Consistent Delta Height CDH 126 hours 18 minutes 0 seconds. Terminal Phase Initiation 126 hours 57 minutes 0 seconds, and Terminal Phase Finalization or the final breaking before docking 127 hours 39 minutes 39.2 seconds. These are Ground computations. And they will be computed by the crew from radar tracking, rendezvous radar. So actually these number computed on the Ground are somewhat academic in that they will be computed in real time by the crew. We're standing by here for Capcom to resume conversation. During this upcoming pass here, more definite fix on the Eagle positions will be attempted by using the rendezvous radar from the Eagle in Program 22, rendezvous radar lunar surface navigation program. The transponder on Columbia in the meantime has been warmed up. During the last revolution, Mike Collins was advised to - have the - the transponder warmed up. As of now, the exact location is somewhat vague. And perhaps this rendezvous radar exercise will give a final, more pinpoint location of where Eagle does indeed nest on the Moon. We'll continue to monitor the air-ground circuit. We've had acquisition of signal with Columbia, so likely the conversation will increase here as we get the - the lockon, hopefully, with rendezvous radar as Columbia passes over the Eagle landing site.

Immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes, sizes, textures, rounded and angular, many with varying consistencies.

Some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger, and they are very thickly populated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim. Beyond that, there is some diminishing, and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows with irregular patterns, and then there are paths between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of hard rocks.

    "This is Apollo Control. We have had loss of signal with Eagle. Quite scratchy as Eagle went over the hill to complete the 25th lunar revolution as it gets to the midpoint on the lunar far side. Ascent burn just completed went quite well on time at 124 hours 22 minutes 0 seconds ground elapsed time. Coming up on this rev, approximately 10 minutes from now as a matter of fact, will be the concentric sequence initiate maneuver, CSI, which will raise the Eagle's perilune to some 45 nautical miles. Eagle now is in an orbit measuring 9.4 nautical miles at insertion or perilune, and 46.7 at apolune, This CSI maneuver will be made approximately at apolune. Therefore, the effect takes place 180 degrees later and has the effect of raising perilune to the desired 45 nautical miles. This maneuver will take place at 125 hours 19 minutes 34.7 seconds. He will have a DELTA-V or velocity change of 51.5 feet per second. All of these maneuvers, incidentally, in the rendezvous sequence by Eagle will be made by using the Reaction Control System of Eagle. Following the CSI at 126 hours 18 minutes 0 seconds a 9.2 foot per second burn, probably mostly a radial burn, at 126 hours 18 minutes will twist the Eagle's orbit to equal distance from the orbit of Columbia, what they call a constant DELTA height, or CDH maneuver. At 126 hours 57 minutes 00 seconds, terminal phase initiation, TPI. In this maneuver the crew visually thrusts along the line of sight toward Columbia when the line of sight is some 27 degrees above the local horizontal. This maneuver will have a magnitude of about 24.9 feet per second, and, in turn, it raises the apolune to 60.5 nautical miles, which is approximately the altitude Columbia's orbiting. Terminal phase finalization. TPF 127 hours 39 minutes 39.2 seconds. This is the start time for a series of small burns which are a combination of mid-course corrections and velocity match maneuvers to bring Eagle in with Columbia and match the velocity so that they station-keep for a short period for photography, etc., and move on in to docking at approximately 128 hours ground elapsed time. In all of these maneuvers Mike Collins aboard Columbia is spring loaded to do what is called a mirror image maneuver approximately a minute after the Eagle is scheduled to make its maneuver, and if for some reason Eagle can not make the maneuver, Collins would do the exact same maneuver only in reverse so that Columbia would in effect begin a CSM active rendezvous with Eagle. As Eagle went over the hill on the 25th revolution, a velocity was being measured at 5410 feet per second. Eagle's weight somewhat lighter than when it started out in excess of 32,000 pounds, it's now shrunk to some 5885 pounds. Some 39 minutes 20 seconds away from acquisition of Columbia. 41 minutes 45 seconds from acquisition of Eagle as the 2 vehicles come around on the 26th revolution. The crew will likely describe how the CSI burn went, which is some 5 minutes away from this point, and at 125 hours 14 minutes ground elapsed time, this is Apollo Control.",

We're nearing the end of the 27th revolution at this time. On the backside of the Moon, Armstrong and Aldrin should be involved in preparing for transferring back to the Command Module with Mike Collins, and they'll be cleaning up equipment and vacuuming off any particles of dust that remain before transferring to the Command Module. About 15 minutes after we reacquire we would expect Neil Armstrong to be ready for the transfer to the Command Module. Buzz Aldrin to follow along behind about 30 or 40 minutes later. Here in Mission Control we're presently completing the shift change. Flight Director, Gene Kranz is replacing Glenn Lunney, and the Capsule Communicator on this shift will be Astronaut Charlie Duke.

The transfer occurring while the spacecraft were on the back side of the Moon. They had closed out the LM early and had transferred to the second coolant loop. That decision was made in Mission Control because the secondary loop was on, the primary loop disabled in the close out process. We did not want to have the LM docked to the CSM for an undue length of time, because the primary guidance system is not cooled. The decision was initially made to jettison the LM at 130 hours 30 minutes, however the crew continued ahead of schedule. They were ready to jettison ahead of that time, and Collins reported at 130 10 about, 17 minutes ago, that they were, had jettisoned the LM and said it had departed at several feet per second, and we heard a comment from Buzz Aldrin, that he noticed some cracks in the thermo covering around the LM tunnel, docking area, however he said it did not appear to be a structural crack but merely some cracks in the thermal covering. We are currently scheduled to perform the small Reaction Control System maneuver with the Command and Service Module for separation from the LM at 130 hours 30 minutes, or about 12 minutes from now.

    "This is Apollo Control. We suspect the crew are having something to eat at this time which probably accounts for the relatively quiet period. One of the things that we are watching with interest here in Mission Control is the Lunar Module. At the time Aldrin and Armstrong left the LM and came back into the Service Module, they switched over to the secondary cooling loop as part of a test that we are running to determine just how long the primary guidance and navigation system will last without cooling. The primary guidance system is not cooled on the secondary loop which provides backup cooling for the secondary guidance system and it has always been a point of interest as to just how long the primary guidance system will survive without cooling - estimates range up to several hours. The LM TEL COMM Controller reports that at this time we are seeing some rise in the PIPAS. These are the Pulse Integrating Pendulum - Pendulous Accelerometers which - the primary guidance system uses to detect changes in motion and attitude and of course they are an essential item in the - the primary guidance system. We are seeing a gradual rise in temperature but the TEL COMM engineer reports that the primary guidance system still looks very good. At the time the crew reported they were back that Armstrong and Aldrin reported that they were back in the Command Module, we asked them what time they did switch over to the secondary loop. Armstrong estimated that that occurred about 129 hours 40 minutes which was a little over 2 hours ago. We will continue to monitor the LM and to observe the performance of the primary guidance system. All systems on the Command and Service Module continue to function very well at this time and the same can be said for the Lunar Module. At the present time we show Apollo 11 in a orbit 62.5 nautical miles by 54.2. The spacecraft traveling at a speed of 5,349 feet per second.",

Among the latest are telegrams from Prime Minister, Harold Wilson of Great Britain and the King of Belgium. The world's press has been dominated by news of Apollo 11. Some newsmen estimate that more than 60 percent of the news used in papers across the country today concerned your mission. The New York Times, which we mentioned before, has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today (even though it ran 950,000 copies) said it will reprint the whole thing on Thursday as a souvenir edition. And Premier Alexei Kosygin has sent congratulations to you and President Nixon through former Vice President Humphrey who is visiting Russia. The cosmonauts have also issued a statement of congratulations. Humphrey quoted Kosygin as saying \"I want you to tell the President and the American people that the Soviet Union desires to work with the United States in the cause of peace.\"",

The Italian police reported that Sunday night was the most crime free night of the year.

While you were busy the other day, Joe Namath and football Commissioner Pete Rozelle made the announcement that \"Broadway Joe\" had agreed to sell his interest in the Bachelors III restaurant and report to the New York Jets. Joe arrived at the Jets' training camp today and had his first workout. Several other Jet players who had held out along with Joe also reported.

A few minutes ago you heard Charlie Duke advise the crew that we show the LM platform is about to go. We've mentioned that prior to leaving the Lunar Module the crew had deactivated the primary coolant loop placing the secondary coolant loop in operation aboard the LM. This means that the primary guidance system does not get cooling. This is part of a preplanned test to find out just how long the primary guidance system would continue to function without cooling. We had predicted in advance that it would - may not - possibly not last much longer than a hour or so, but at the time Charlie Duke reported the platform had just gone down on the LM, it had been in operation without cooling a little more than four hours. We had an approximate time from the crew of transferring to the secondary coolant loop of about 129 hours 40 minutes and we got the report from Duke that the LM guidance platform was no longer usable at 133 hours 55 minutes. We'll continue to standby for any further conversation from the crew.

We've gotten some preliminary figures from the Flight Dynamics Officer on that transearth injection burn after a review of the telemetry data and it shows that our change in velocity was nominal 3,283.5 feet per second. We also show a nominal burn time of 2 minutes, 28 seconds. The crew reported the burn time about 2 to 3 seconds long based on their onboard data. The ground data shows the burn to have been just about nominal. Based on the preliminary tracking it would appear that the splash down would occur almost precisely as predicted or planned in the Flight Plan. That would be at 195 hours and 18 minutes, 40 seconds Ground Elapsed Time. And we would expect that splash down time to change somewhat during the transearth coast particularly as the need or lack of need for mid-course correction becomes more apparent with additional tracking. At this time Apollo 11 is 4,086 nautical miles from the Moon, and traveling at almost precisely 1 mile per second, 5,283 feet per second and that's just updated 5,280 feet per second.",

At about 5,900 nautical miles from the Moon, and about 198,900 nautical miles from Earth. A short while ago, you heard Neil Armstrong make a few descriptive comments of the scene on the lunar surface at the time the planned Ascent Stage lifted off. Armstrong reported seeing very little dust, but quite a bit of debris from the LM. He referred to the Kapton, which is a plastic-like insulation material generally silver or gold in color which is found on the outside surfaces of the LM. And, we also had a report at 136 hours, 54 minutes, about 40 minutes or so ago that the LM guidance computer had finally stopped putting out any data, and that was about 7 hours, 13 minutes after the primary guidance system was deprived of the coolant, in a test of how the system would continue to operate without coolant. The platform apparently began to become unuseable after about 4 hours, and the computer itself finally gave up after about 7 hours, 13 minutes. Both items going considerably longer than had previously been predicted. The Lunar Module Ascent Stage still in lunar orbit. We are continuing to get data from it. All other systems appear to be functioning well at this time. The LM orbit we show as currently 64.4 nautical miles for height of apocynthion, 54.4 nautical miles for pericynthion. And, the LM is in its 23rd revolution, and here's a call to the crew.",

    "Roger. From the hot wires of the Public Affairs Office: Apollo 11 still dominates the news around the world. Only four nations, Communist China, North Korea, North Viet Nam, and Albania, have not yet informed their citizens of your flight and landing on the Moon. One newsman said that he has run out of ways to describe your success. Tonight, President Nixon is scheduled to watch the All Star baseball game in Washington. After the game, he will depart for the Pacific recovery area. Wednesday evening, he will fly from Johnston Island by helicopter to the Navy communications ship Arlington. Then on Thursday morning, he will reboard the helicopter and fly to the Hornet in time to witness your splashdown. Accompanying the President will be Secretary of State, William Rogers and Frank Borman. They will watch the splashdown from the bridge of the recovery ship with Admiral John Sidney McCain, Jr., Commander of the Pacific Forces. Following the President's stay aboard the Hornet, he will depart for his tour of Asia and scheduled visit to Romania. Luna 15 is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Crises yesterday after orbiting the Moon 52 times. The Soviet News Agency TASS reported that \"scientific research in near Moon space was carried out.\" Sir Bernard Lovell at Jodrell Bank Observatory said that Luna 15 hit the surface of the Moon at a speed of about 300 miles per hour. Things have been relatively quiet recently in Viet Nam. GI's on patrol were observed carrying transistor radios tuned into your flight. The Armed Forces radio and TV network in Viet Nam gave the mission full coverage. Skirmishes still continue between the Egyptians and Israelis along the Suez Canal. U.N. observers there are trying to halt the action. In Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted to reduce the 27.5 percent oil depletion allowance to 20 percent. We've had rain several times here in the Houston area. Today it is cloudy, and more showers are expected. On the sports front, as we mentioned earlier, the All Star game is tonight. There were no games played yesterday. Last night in New York, the Baseball Writers Association of America named Babe Ruth the greatest ball player of all time. Joe DiMaggio was named the greatest living ball player. Frank Borman made the announcements at a dinner honoring the players. Joe Namath put in a full day at the New York Jets' training camp. Five policemen had a hard time restraining about 500 kids who wanted to touch Broadway Joe. He said he feels fine and will play in the All Star game August 1, if Coach Weeb Eubank lets him. The Oilers' camp at Kerrville got wet yesterday, but the workouts continued. There have been some minor injuries, but nothing too serious. Coach Wally Lemm is satisfied so far with the workouts. The Oilers are expecting attendance by over 30.000 for the preseason game with Buffalo. Apparently, Don Meredith's retirement isn't expected to dampen enthusiasm, especially around here in Houston. Mario Andretti won the 200 mile Trenton Auto Race Sunday and is now the leading race driver in the U.S. Auto Club's point standings.

I got two barber poles indicating that the three capture latches - not capture latches, but the three ... latches had made, and we were soft docked. And at that time the situation looked very stable. So, I went to CMC FREE, glanced back out the window and it still looked stable; and I fired primary 2 bottle. And at that time, a gyration began between the two vehicles due I'm not sure to what. Perhaps the LM thrusting or perhaps it was building up prior, and I hadn't noticed it. But anyway, during the RETRACT of the probe, there were yaw - my yaw excursions of, I would guess, around 15 degrees, and I had to come back on, take the FREE switch and throw it back to AUTO, and try to damp them out; and I guess Neil was doing the same in the LM. I'll let him tell you about his side of it. And I though that we were not going to get a successful RETRACT and hard dock. However, in about - oh, I guess 6 or 8 seconds, I did hear - could see the situation damping out, and then we heard the noise indicating the docking latches had fired; and later on when I got into the tunnel, all 12 of them had properly engaged.",

That is scheduled to occur 150 hours 29 minutes 54 seconds. It will be a Reaction Control System burn using the spacecraft Reaction Control System thrusters. With a velocity change of 4.8 feet per second, and that will be retrograde. Primary purpose of the maneuver will be to adjust the entry conditions which is - would primarily be for corridor control, controlling the flight path angle at entry. And the current predicted splash time in the Pacific is 195 hours 17 minutes 25 seconds. At the present time Apollo 11 is 172,654 nautical miles from the Earth, traveling at a speed of 4017 feet per second. We estimate that the spacecraft will be half way home at a Ground Elapsed Time of 159 hours 53 minutes 43 seconds. At that point the spacecraft will 145,583 nautical miles from the Earth's surface, and we will have completed half of the return trip measured from Lunar Orbit Insertion to splashdown. Now we also have another figure that - before the time of which the spacecraft velocity is equal with respect to both the Earth and the Moon. At that point the velocity will be 4300 feet per second with respect to both bodies. And we would define this as the equal potential point. That will occur at 155 hours 30 minutes. And at that time the spacecraft will 156,874 nautical miles from the Earth, 52,543 nautical miles from the Moon.

    "Roger. This trip of ours to the Moon may have looked, to you, simple or easy. I'd like to assure you that has not been the case. The Saturn V rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly. This computer up above my head has a 38,000 word vocabulary, each word of which has been very carefully chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the crew. This switch which I have in my hand now, has over 300 counterparts in the Command Module alone, this one single switch design. In addition to that, there are myriads of circuit breakers, levers, rods, and other associated controls. The SPS engine, our large rocket engine on the aft end of our Service Module, must have performed flawlessly, or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plummet into the ocean. We have always had confidence that all this equipment will work, and work properly, and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people. First, the American workmen who put these pieces of machinery together in the factories. Second, the painstaking work done by the various test teams during the assembly and retest after assembly. And finally, the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight control, and last, but not least, in crew training. This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine.

    "Good evening. I'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, Apollo 11. As we've been discussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here onboard our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Neil's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the Moon, \"This is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind,\" I believe sums up these feelings very nicely. We accepted the challenge of going to the Moon; the acceptance of this challenge was inevitable. The relative ease with which we carried out our mission, I believe, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acceptance. Today, I feel we're fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space. In retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously chose for our spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the U.S. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the Earth, from the planet Earth to the Moon; that symbol being the olive branch. It was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the Moon. Personally, in reflecting the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind to me. \"When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him.\"",

We would like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built those spacecraft, who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their - their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people, tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.",

The reason is that the hatch bag straps are only configured for zero g, and it is a pretty difficult job getting it lashed down.

We've run this procedure in the simulator, and it works fine. Basically, I'll go through it - just go through it, and then if you have any questions come back. But it's the same lift vector up until MAX g, and then lift vector down, and then modulate the lift vector until g dot goes to zero. Okay. This procedure is essentially the same so far. And then hold g dot zero until you pass the RETRO elapsed time of V circular; and then after you pass this RETRO elapsed time of V circular, roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees, and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you come to the RETRO elapsed time of drogues.

And I say this not only because I have the honor to be President of the United States, but particularly because I have the privilege of speaking for so many in welcoming you back to Earth. I could tell you about all the messages we received in Washington. Over one hundred foreign governments, Emperors, and Presidents and Prime Ministers and Kings have sent the most warm messages that we have ever received. They represent over 2 billion people on this Earth. All of them who have had the opportunity through television to see what you have done. And then I also bring you messages from members of the Cabinet and members of the Senate and members of the House and the Space Agency. From the streets of San Francisco where people stopped me a few days ago, and you all love that city, I know, as I do. But most important, I had a telephone call yesterday. The toll wasn't, incidentally, as great as the one I made to you fellows on the Moon. (Laughter) I made that collect, incidentally, in case you didn't know. But I called the three of, in my view, three of the greatest ladies and most courageous ladies in the whole world today, your wives. And from Jan and Joan and Pat, I bring their love and their congratulations. We think that it is just wonderful that they could have participated, at least through television, in this return; we're only sorry they couldn't be here. And also, I've got to let you in on a little secret - I made a date with them. (Laughter) I invited them to dinner on the 13th of August, right after you come out of quarantine. It will be a state dinner held in Los Angeles. The governors of all the fifty States will be there, the ambassadors, others from around the world and in America. And they told me that you would come too. And all I want to know - will you come? We want to honor you then.",

    "Well, just let me close off with this one thing. I - I was thinking as you know, as you came down and we knew it was a success, and it had only been eight days, just a week, a long week. But this is the greatest week in the history of the world since the creation. Because as a result of what happened in this week, the world is bigger, infinitely. And also, as I'm going to find on this trip around the world, and as Secretary Rogers will find as he covers the other countries and Asia, as a result of what you've done the world's never been closer together before. And we just thank you for that. And I only hope that all of us in government, all of us in America, that as a result of what you've done, we can do our job a little better. We can reach for the stars, just as you have reached so far for the stars. We don't want to hold you any longer. Anybody have a last re... How about promotions, do you think we could arrange something? (Laughter)",

    "Let us pray. Lord, God, our Heavenly Father. Our minds are staggered and our spirit exalted with the magnitude and precision of this entire Apollo 11 mission. We have spent the past week in communal anxiety and hope as our astronauts sped through the glories and dangers of the heavens. As we try to understand and analyze the scope of this achievement for human life, our reason is overwhelmed with abounding gratitude and joy, even as we realize the increasing challenges of the future. This magnificent event illustrates anew what man can accomplish when purpose is firm and intent corporate. A man on the Moon was promised in this decade. And, though some were unconvinced, the reality is with us this morning, in the persons of astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. We applaud their splendid exploits and we pour out our thanksgiving for their safe return to us, to their families, to all mankind. From our inmost beings, we sing humble, yet exuberant praise. May the great effort and commitment seen in this project, Apollo, inspire our lives to move similarly in other areas of need. May we the people by our enthusiasm and devotion and insight move to new landings in brotherhood, human concern, and mutual respect. May our country, afire with inventive leadership and backed by a committed followership, blaze new trails into all areas of human cares. See our enthusiasm and bless our joy with dedicated purpose for the many needs at hand. Link us in friendship with peoples throughout the world as we strive together to better the human condition. Grant us peace, beginning in our own hearts, and a mind attuned with good will towards our neighbor. All this we pray as our thanksgiving rings out to Thee. In the name of our Lord, amen.",
